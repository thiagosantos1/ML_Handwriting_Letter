# Letter Recognition

# Main idea
	* A simple convolutional neural network, implemented in Keras.
	* The goal is to be able to classify/recognize pictures as one of the letters of the english alphabet(A-Z).

# Accuracy
	* With the help of a GPU(I have used floyd platform), we were able to get an accuracy of 88%
